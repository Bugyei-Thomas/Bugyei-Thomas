## $ whoami: Thomas Bugyei  ~ Certified In Cybersecurity | Ethical Hacker
I am a certified cybersecurity professional with a sharp focus in ethical hacking. If it's connected, I'm on it, whether it's **wireless networks**, **mobile devices**, **corporate systems**, or **web applications**. My mission? To explore, secure, and elevate anything that speaks ones and zeros.
