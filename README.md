## $ whoami:~ Thomas Bugyei  ~ Certified In Cybersecurity | Ethical Hacker
I am a certified cybersecurity professional with a sharp focus in ethical hacking. If it's connected to the internet, I'm on it, whether it's **wireless networks**, **mobile devices**, **corporate systems**, or **web applications**. My mission? To explore, secure, and elevate anything that speaks ones and zeros.

### 🔍 What I Do
- **Web Security:** Penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and fortifying web apps to be bulletproof against threats.

- **Network Security:** Scanning and securing networks by identifying vulnerable open ports and misconfigurations that could be exploited.

- **System Pentesting:** Hardening systems and uncovering exploits before they can be used against you...by me or anyone else.

- **Mobile Security:** Safeguarding mobile platforms from the latest threats, securing apps, and defending against vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Evaluating security architecture, identifying potential risks, and providing strategies to mitigate them.

### Fun Fact
