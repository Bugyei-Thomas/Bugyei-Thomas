## $ whoami: Thomas Bugyei  ~ Certified In Cybersecurity | Ethical Hacker
I am a certified cybersecurity professional with a sharp focus in ethical hacking. If it's connected, I'm on it, whether it's **wireless networks**, **mobile devices**, **corporate systems**, or **web applications**. My mission? To explore, secure, and elevate anything that speaks ones and zeros.

### 🔍 What I Do
- **Wireless Security**: Cracking open the airwaves, finding the weak spots, and locking them down.
- **Mobile Security**: From apps to OS vulnerabilities, I dig deep to uncover what others might miss.
- **System Security**: Hardening systems and finding exploits before they find you, or worse someone else does.
- **Web Security**: Pen-testing, vulnerability assessments, and ensuring web apps are bulletproof.

### 💼 Projects
I'm not working on anything public right now, but that’s just the calm before the storm. New projects are on the horizon, and when they drop, you’ll see some serious innovation. Stay tuned.
